Script Conversion

This script converts Python scripts (``.py`` and ``.ipynb``) into Markdown files (``.md``). It prioritizes readability and error handling by logging issues and creating a well-formatted Markdown output. The script uses a configuration file for logging and supports both single-file scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. It utilizes command-line arguments for flexible configuration and employs regular expressions for handling images within the source files.
